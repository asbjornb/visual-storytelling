# TODO - US Territorial Expansion

## You (Asbjorn)
- [ ] Sign up for Nano Banana and get API key
- [ ] Install Claude Chrome extension for inspecting live output together
- [ ] Finish research on 1776 Declaration of Independence section
- [ ] Review/approve visual style direction once first section is rendering
- [ ] Write/refine narrative text for each timeline entry (the PDF is a starting point, not final copy)

## Claude
- [ ] Download Michael Porath's historical GeoJSON dataset and add to project
- [ ] Scaffold the scrollytelling page (HTML/CSS/JS, D3, scroll-triggered sections)
- [ ] Get the base map rendering with Albers USA projection
- [ ] Implement scroll-driven territory transitions (each acquisition fills in on scroll)
- [ ] Build the 1776 prologue section (13 colonies outline, Declaration quote)
- [ ] Build the Nano Banana image generation script (reads JSONL specs, calls API, saves images)
- [ ] Create initial JSONL with image prompts for each timeline entry
- [ ] Add text panels, quotes, and data callouts (price, area) per section
- [ ] Handle overseas territory insets (Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, etc.)
- [ ] Style the 2025-26 epilogue differently (rhetoric vs history)
- [ ] Add timeline/progress indicator

## Later
- [ ] Attach custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Add Open Graph / social sharing meta tags
- [ ] Mobile responsive polish
- [ ] Performance optimization (lazy load illustrations, etc.)
