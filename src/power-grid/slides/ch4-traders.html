          Energy trading is one way electricity systems stay coordinated.
          Markets reveal scarcity through prices: which plants
          should run, where power should flow, who carries risk. Hedging
          locks in prices ahead of time; arbitrage aligns them across
          regions.

          In the visualisation, cheap Nordic hydro clears toward
          higher-priced Germany. The flow is physical and grid-constrained,
          but its direction comes from prices. Markets can misprice risk or
          amplify volatility, so when forecasts fail or shocks hit,
          operators step in. The system works because markets and operators
          each do what they&rsquo;re best at.

          wealth transfer to traders. Economists genuinely debate the
          proportion. ACER

          ~&euro;34&nbsp;billion per year in consumer benefits from
          integrated European power markets&mdash;though one could argue
          markets can be integrated without being fully liberalised.
