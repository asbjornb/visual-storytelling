          Energy trading is one way electricity systems stay coordinated.
          Markets reveal scarcity through prices &mdash; which plants
          should run, where power should flow, who carries risk. Hedging

          regions.

          higher-priced Germany. The flow is physical and grid-constrained,
          but its direction comes from prices. Markets can misprice risk or
          amplify volatility, so when forecasts fail or shocks hit,
          operators step in. The system works because markets and operators
          each do what they&rsquo;re best at.
