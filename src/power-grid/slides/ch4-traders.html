          Energy trading is one way electricity systems stay coordinated.
          Markets handle most day-to-day decisions by revealing scarcity
          through prices (price discovery): which plants should run, where
          power should flow, and who carries risk. Hedging locks in prices
          ahead of time, while arbitrage aligns prices across regions.

          In the visualisation, cheap Nordic hydro clears toward
          higher-priced Germany. The flow is physical and constrained by the
          grid but the direction and amount comes from prices. Trading does
          not replace system operators or regulation: markets can misprice
          risk or amplify volatility. Liquidity helps prices adjust, but
          when forecasts fail or shocks occur, operators step in to keep the
          system stable. The system works because markets and operators each
          do what they&rsquo;re best at.

          The honest answer: some trading benefits consumers, some is a
          wealth transfer to traders. Economists genuinely debate the
          proportion.
